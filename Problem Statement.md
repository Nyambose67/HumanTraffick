
Problem Statement
Human trafficking remains one of the most pressing global issues, affecting millions of people each year. Traffickers continue to exploit digital platforms, including phishing emails, to communicate and carry out their illegal activities. Additionally, understanding trends in human trafficking cases over time is essential for anticipating and responding to this evolving threat.

Our project addresses these two crucial aspects:

Phishing Email Detection for Human Trafficking: We aim to develop a machine learning model that can analyze phishing emails, identify potential trafficking-related content, and provide actionable insights for preventing and intervening in trafficking cases.

Human Trafficking Case Forecasting: Using a time-series forecasting model, we aim to predict future trends in human trafficking cases, allowing authorities to better allocate resources and plan interventions based on anticipated spikes in trafficking activities.

This dual approach enhances the ability to both detect and predict human trafficking, contributing to more effective prevention strategies.
