        "### Dataset Relevance to Human Trafficking\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset I’m working with includes several columns that provide important insights into human trafficking cases. Here’s how each of these columns is relevant:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`REGION` and `SUB-REGION`**  \n",
        "   These columns help me identify where trafficking cases are happening, which is crucial for knowing which areas are most affected. This geographic information allows us to focus efforts where they are needed most.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`INDICATOR`**  \n",
        "   This likely refers to the specific type of trafficking (like forced labor or sex trafficking), helping me categorize the nature of the cases. Knowing the type of trafficking is essential for developing targeted solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`DIMENSION`**  \n",
        "   This column seems to reflect various factors or aspects of trafficking cases. Breaking down the problem into different dimensions helps me understand the complexity of each case and focus on specific details.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`CATEGORY`**  \n",
        "   This column classifies the type of trafficking, like labor or sex trafficking. Understanding the specific category allows for more tailored intervention strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **`SEX`**  \n",
        "   This shows the gender of the victims, which helps me see if there’s a gender-based pattern. Different genders may be affected in different ways, so this helps in designing gender-specific interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **`AGE`**  \n",
        "   Knowing the age group of the victims is key since trafficking affects children, teens, and adults differently. This information is crucial for creating age-appropriate support and prevention measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **`YEAR`**  \n",
        "   This column tracks when cases were reported, which helps me analyze trends over time. By looking at changes year by year, I can understand whether the situation is getting better or worse.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **`COUNTS`**  \n",
        "   This seems to represent the number of cases, which is fundamental for understanding the scale of the problem. I can use this to compare the volume of cases across different regions, categories, or years.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **`CASE-VALUE`**  \n",
        "   This column likely represents the actual number of trafficking cases for each entry, making it a key measure of the issue. It allows me to see which regions or demographics are most affected.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **`SOURCE`**  \n",
        "   Knowing where the data came from, such as police reports or NGO data, helps me assess the reliability and scope of the information. It also gives me context for how different cases might be reported.\n",
        "\n",
